# ColorConstancy
The goal of color constancy methods is to transform the colors
of an image I, acquired under an unknown light source,
so that they appear identical to colors under a canonical light
source. This task is accomplished by performing two separate
steps: estimation of the color of the light source in RGB coordinates,
e = [eR eG eB]
T
, and transformation of the image
using the estimated illuminant
